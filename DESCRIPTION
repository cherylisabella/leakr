Description: Provides utilities to detect common data leakage patterns including train/test
           contamination, temporal leakage, and data duplication, enhancing model reliability and
           reproducibility in machine learning workflows. Generates diagnostic reports and visual
           summaries to support data validation. Methods based on best practices from Hastie,
           Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009, ISBN:978-0387848570).
